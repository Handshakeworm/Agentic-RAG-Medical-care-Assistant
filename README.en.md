# Agentic-RAG Medical Care Assistant

> Patient-side symptom self-check and initial diagnosis system, powered by a LangGraph Agent and multi-route RAG.
>
> **Personal portfolio project** (not production-deployed), covering data engineering → ML inference → Agent orchestration → backend → infrastructure → evaluation as a full end-to-end stack.
> Spec-driven design and implementation, single source of truth: [DEV_SPEC.md](DEV_SPEC.md) (4976 lines, Chinese).

## Evaluation Results (62 cases from Chinese licensed-physician exam, 2026-05-17)

> Two-layer evaluation: **① RAG retrieval** (does recall cover the right textbook section?) → **② Diagnosis** (can the LLM produce the correct diagnosis based on recalled chunks?)

### ① RAG retrieval quality (LLM Judge scores parents 0~3 as ground truth)

| Metric | Score | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Hit@20 (≥3 highly relevant)** | **100%** | 62/62 cases — **no case misses a highly-relevant section** |
| **NDCG@20** | **0.774** | Ranking quality (medical-domain range typically 0.6~0.8) |
| **MRR (≥2)** | **0.954** | Top-1 is at least moderately relevant in almost every case |
| Spearman ρ vs LLM | +0.708 | RAG ranking strongly correlated with LLM judgment |

### ② Diagnosis accuracy (LLM diagnoses on RAG Top-20; Judge evaluates gold ↔ LLM equivalence)

> **Multi-gold case**: a case where the patient has multiple coexisting diseases/comorbidities (e.g. "splenic rupture + rib fracture", "acute MI + acute left heart failure" — about half of the 62 cases)

| Metric | Score | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Top-1 clinical hit rate** | **93.5%** | LLM's first candidate is clinically equivalent to gold (58/62) |
| **Top-3 hit rate** | **100%** | Gold primary diagnosis always in top 3 — **62/62 no missed diagnosis** |
| **0 primary direction errors** | **0/62** | All cases produced the correct diagnostic direction (no `none`) |
| **Multi-gold average coverage** | **86.7%** | Multi-gold cases have 86.7% of gold diagnoses listed on average |
| Multi-gold full recall rate | 72.6% | Multi-gold cases where ALL gold diagnoses are covered (45/62) |

## Project Positioning

**What it does**: User describes symptoms in natural language. The system clarifies history through multi-round follow-up, retrieves 13 medical textbooks as the knowledge base, and **gives an initial diagnosis + differential directions + recommended further exams**. 62-case Chinese licensed-physician exam evaluation: **Top-1 clinical-equivalent hit rate 93.5%, Top-3 100%, zero primary-direction errors** (see [Evaluation Results](#evaluation-results-62-cases-from-chinese-licensed-physician-exam-2026-05-17) above).

**Who it serves**: Patients needing initial diagnostic judgment and care navigation. All LLM outputs are filtered by a `safety_gate` node — **no prescriptions, no replacement for face-to-face physician care**. The system's role is "give the diagnostic directions a physician might consider + recommend how to investigate further"; final diagnosis and treatment still rest with a licensed physician.

**What it doesn't do**: Direct imaging interpretation, surgical planning, pediatric specialization, drug dosing calculation — these require specialized models or on-site physician judgment, out of scope.
